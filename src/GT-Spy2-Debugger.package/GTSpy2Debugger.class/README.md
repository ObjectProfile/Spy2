I am a debugger for Spy2. I eliminate from the stack all execution contexts related to Spy2 and provide better debugging actions.

I can be used if the stack contains an execution context related to Spy2.
Use 'self moldableHalt' to automatically switch to this debugger or the stack toolbar menu of the default debugger.
