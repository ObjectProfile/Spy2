	"Scan the key array for the first slot containing either a nil (indicating an empty slot) or an element that matches anObject. Answer the index of that slot or zero if no slot is found. Expired associations are ignored, since callers take non-nil slots as a successful search. Subclasses should override startIndexFor: and compare:to: if they have a different semantics for matching elements."
