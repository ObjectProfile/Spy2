flattened
	
	"Flattens a collection of collections (no matter how many levels of collections exist).
	Strings are considered atoms and, as such, won't be flattened
	
	Examples:
	#(1 #(2 3) #(4 (#5))) flattened returns #(1 2 3 4 5) 
	#('string1' #('string2' 'string3')) flattened returns #('string1' 'string2' 'string3')"
