	"Answer a copy of the receiver satisfying the following conditions: If 
	stop is less than start, then this is an insertion; stop should be exactly 
	start-1, start = 1 means insert before the first character, start = size+1 
	means append after last character. Otherwise, this is a replacement; start 
	and stop have to be within the receiver's bounds."
